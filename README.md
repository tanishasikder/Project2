Changes and documentation of the code

The MemoryGame and Tile classes act as the model. The Tile class just makes the
tile object (mostly the same as the starter code).
The MemoryGame class contains the major business logic of the game. Has methods
such as initializing tiles and checking for matches, just like the starter code.
There are many methods that were added, however. It has methods to update any
business logic, such as the number of seconds that have passed, matches that were
made, etc. These are further used by the controller class to update the game.
There are also getter methods in the MemoryGame class for the controller class
to use.


Btw I removed most of the files in the source code cuz a lot of them were exclusive
to the repository the source code is from. The game runs fine without them
